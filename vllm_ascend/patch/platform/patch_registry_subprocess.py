"""Keep ms_service_profiler out of the model-inspection subprocess.

vLLM derives ``_ModelInfo`` from a model class in a short-lived subprocess
spawned by ``vllm.model_executor.models.registry._run_in_subprocess`` (kept
off-process to avoid initializing CUDA).  When ``SERVICE_PROF_CONFIG_PATH`` is
set, ``ms_service_profiler`` auto-starts in *every* Python process via its
sitecustomize hook -- including this inspection subprocess.  There the
profiler's C++ thread fires a ctypes callback into Python; because the process
is about to exit, the callback hits an inconsistent interpreter state and
segfaults in ``PyGILState_Ensure`` -> ``new_threadstate`` (SIGSEGV, callback
address ``0xffffffffffffffff``).  The crash kills the inspection, so model
architectures such as ``Qwen3_5MTP`` "fail to be inspected" and
``SpeculativeConfig`` validation aborts service startup.  This is why enabling
profiling breaks MTP (and only MTP): the speculative draft-model architecture
is the inspection path triggered during ``create_engine_config``.

The inspection subprocess never runs inference and has no use for profiling.
Temporarily scrub the profiler env vars from ``os.environ`` for the duration of
the subprocess spawn so the profiler does not auto-load there, then restore
them.  Other subprocesses (engine core, workers) are spawned by separate code
paths and keep profiling.

This wraps the module-level ``_run_in_subprocess`` symbol; the only call site
(``_LazyRegisteredModel.inspect_model_cls``) resolves it through the registry
module globals at call time, so the replacement takes effect.
